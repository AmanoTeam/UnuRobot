"Follow these steps:\n"
"\n"
"1. Add this bot to a group\n"
"2. In the group, start a new game with /new or join an already running game "
"with /join\n"
"3. After at least two players have joined, start the game with /start\n"
"4. Type <code>@UnuRobot</code> into your chat box and hit <b>space</b>, or "
"click the <code>via @UnuRobot</code> text next to messages. You will see "
"your cards (some greyed out), any extra options like drawing, and a <b>?</b> "
"to see the current game state. The <b>greyed out cards</b> are those you "
"<b>can not play</b> at the moment. Tap an option to execute the selected "
"action.\n"
"Players can join the game at any time. To leave a game, use /leave. If a "
"player takes more than 90 seconds to play, you can use /skip to skip that "
"player. Use /notify_me to receive a private message when a new game is "
"started.\n"
"\n"
"<b>Language</b> and other settings: /settings\n"
"Other commands (only game creator):\n"
"/close - Close lobby\n"
"/open - Open lobby\n"
"/kill - Terminate the game\n"
"/kick - Select a player to kick by replying to him or her\n"
"/enable_translations - Translate relevant texts into all languages spoken in "
"a game\n"
"/disable_translations - Use English for those texts\n"
"\n"
"<b>Experimental:</b> Play in multiple groups at the same time. Press the "
"<code>Current game: ...</code> button and select the group you want to play "
"a card in.\n"
"If you enjoy this bot, <a href=\"https://t.me/storebot?start=UnuRobot\">rate "
"me</a>, join the <a href=\"https://t.me/UnuRobotUpdates\">update channel</a> "
"and buy an UNO card game."

"This UNO bot has five game modes: Classic, Sanic, Wild, Text and 7-0.\n"
"\n"
" üéª The Classic mode uses the conventional UNO deck and there is no auto "
"skip.\n"
" üöÄ The Sanic mode uses the conventional UNO deck and the bot automatically "
"skips a player if he/she takes too long to play its turn\n"
" üêâ The Wild mode uses a deck with more special cards, less number variety "
"and no auto skip.\n"
" ‚úçÔ∏è The Text mode uses the conventional UNO deck but instead of stickers it "
"uses the text.\n"
" üî´ The 7-0 mode uses the conventional UNO deck but when a player plays a 7, "
"he/she can choose a player to swap cards with. When a player plays a 0, all "
"cards will be swapped between the current players.\n"
"\n"
"To change the game mode, the GAME CREATOR has to type the bot nickname and a "
"space, just like when playing a card, and all gamemode options should appear."
